I implemented the Luhn algorithm in Luhn.c
The Luhn algorithm's wikipedia entry describes it below:
 
The Luhn algorithm or Luhn formula, also known as the "modulus 10" or i
"mod 10" algorithm, is a simple checksum formula used to validate a 
variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers

You can use this program as follows:

Luhn [infile] [outfile]

Where the infile contains the numbers you wish to check and the outfile
is the name you would like to give the file this program will write to.
The output file will match each number given with a "true" or "false".
"true" of course being if the number passes the test and "false" if it
does not.  

Input other than numbers is invalid.
